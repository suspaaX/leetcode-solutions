Hint
Given an array of string words, return all strings in words that are a substring of another word. You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["mass","as","hero","superhero"]

Explanation: "as" is substring of "mass" and "hero" is substring of "superhero".
["hero","as"] is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: words = ["leetcode","et","code"]
Output: ["et","code"]
Explanation: "et", "code" are substring of "leetcode".
Example 3:

Input: words = ["blue","green","bu"]
Output: []
