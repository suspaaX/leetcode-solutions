Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.

A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.

For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcde", goal = "abced"
Output: false
'''

s = "abcde"
goal = "cdeab"
Output: True

def rotateString(s, goal):
    val = []
    for idx,elem in enumerate(s):
        val.append(idx)
    print(idx)


rotateString(s, goal)
