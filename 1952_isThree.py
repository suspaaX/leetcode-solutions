1952. Three Divisors

Given an integer n, return true if n has exactly three positive divisors. Otherwise, return false.

An integer m is a divisor of n if there exists an integer k such that n = k * m.

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: false
Explantion: 2 has only two divisors: 1 and 2.
Example 2:

Input: n = 4
Output: true
Explantion: 4 has three divisors: 1, 2, and 4.

'''

n = 4
Output: True
# Explantion: 4 has three divisors: 1, 2, and 4.

n = 2
Output = False

def isThree(n):
    lst = []
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if n%i == 0:
            lst.append(i)

    if len(lst) == 3:
        return True
    else:
        return False
    
print(isThree(n))
